# Market Rules Playbook

## Purpose
Provide a reusable framework for drafting airtight, dispute-proof rules in prediction markets.

---
## Rule Structure
1. **Clear Resolution Criteria**
   - Define measurable conditions (e.g., "Candidate X is declared winner by Associated Press").
   - Include specific sources and timestamps.

2. **Trusted Sources Hierarchy**
   - Primary: Official government/league announcements.
   - Secondary: Reputable news agencies (AP, Reuters, Bloomberg).
   - Tertiary: Platform-defined tie-breaker process.

3. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Unexpected outcomes (withdrawals, cancellations).
   - Multi-event resolution scenarios.
   - Timeline shifts (delays, recounts).

4. **Examples**
   - *Politics*: "Will Candidate A win the 2024 US Presidential Election?"
   - *Sports*: "Will Team X win the UEFA Champions League 2025 Final?"
   - *Crypto*: "Will BTC close above $50,000 on Dec 31, 2025 (UTC)?"
